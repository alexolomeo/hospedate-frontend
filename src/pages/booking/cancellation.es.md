# Cancellation Policy

_Effective date: 2025-08-27_

This Cancellation Policy explains when guests are eligible for refunds and what happens if a reservation is changed or cancelled on Hospédate. All times are measured in the **property’s local time zone** and all refunds are issued in the **listing currency** (conversion differences may apply).

---

## 1) Before the Host Accepts

Your reservation **is not confirmed** until the host accepts the request (usually within **24 hours**).

- **No charges** are made before acceptance.
- If the host does not respond within the time limit, the request expires and **no payment is collected**.

## 2) Guest Cancellations (after host acceptance)
